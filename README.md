**Flight Fare Price Prediction Project**



**Overview:**
Flight Fare Price Prediction Project is a data science endeavor that aims to predict flight ticket fares based on various factors that influence pricing. As air travel becomes an integral part of modern lifestyles, the ability to estimate flight fares accurately can help travelers plan their trips more efficiently and save money and time. This repository contains the code and resources for building and deploying a machine learning model capable of predicting flight fares with high accuracy.

**Features:**
- Utilizes historical flight data: The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of historical flight records, encompassing various features such as flight timings, destinations, durations, and fares.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering: The data preprocessing pipeline handles missing values, performs feature engineering, and converts categorical variables into numerical representations to prepare the data for modeling.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: The project incorporates different regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and more, to identify the best model for predicting flight fares.
- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is implemented using cross-validation techniques to optimize the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
- Web Application (Optional): The project can be optionally deployed as a web application, allowing users to input their flight details and obtain fare predictions conveniently.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the data preprocessing and model training scripts to build the prediction model.
4. Optionally, deploy the model as a web application using the provided web application code.
5. Use the trained model to predict flight fares based on different factors and optimize your travel plans.

**Contributing:**
Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether you want to improve data preprocessing, experiment with different models, enhance the web application, or add new features, feel free to submit pull requests.
